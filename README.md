## AWS Glue Catalog Client For Apache Hive Metastore

The Glue Data Catalog is a metastore which provides a unified metadata repository across a variety of data sources and data formats, integrating with Amazon EMR as well as Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Redshift Spectrum, Athena, and any application compatible with the Apache Hive metastore. Customers want to use a single managed metadata store across all their analytics workloads. Today they can use Glue Data Catalog only with Athena, EMR, and Redshfit Spectrum but not with third party solutions like Databricks, Qubole, or their own hadoop environments running on AWS. Making this connector available, will allow customers and partners to build integrations to the Glue Data Catalog and will thus ease the adoption of Glue Data Catalog for many customers.
