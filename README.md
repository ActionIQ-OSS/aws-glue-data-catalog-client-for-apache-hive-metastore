## AWS Glue Data Catalog Client for Apache Hive Metastore
The AWS Glue Data Catalog is a fully managed, Apache Hive Metastore compatible, metadata repository. Customers can use the Data Catalog as a central repository to store structural and operational metadata for their data.

AWS Glue provides out-of-box integration with Amazon EMR that enables customers to use the AWS Glue Data Catalog as a replacement for an external Hive Metastore. To learn more, visit our [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-hive-metastore-glue.html).

With this client, customers and partners can now use the AWS Glue Data Catalog with their own Apache Hadoop environments as a replacement for an external Hive Metastore.
